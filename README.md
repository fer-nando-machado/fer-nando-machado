# 🌍 Hello, World!

🧑🏽‍💻 My name is **Fernando Machado**. I have been working as a **Full-Stack Software Developer** since 2007.

🤲🏽 I am fluent in **Agile** development practices, I have experience with multiple programming languages and I love to find ways of bringing people and technology together to create innovative products that can solve real world problems.

🙌🏽 I believe that authentic communication, intercultural collaboration, short feedback cycles and continuous experimenting and learning are the keys to the success of a team, a project and an entire company.

🫶🏽 Check out a selection of my **public projects** [here](https://github.com/fernandomachado90).

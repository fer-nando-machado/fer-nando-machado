## 🧑🏽‍💻  Hello, world!

My name is **Fernando Machado**. I have been working with software development since 2007.

I am a Senior Full-Stack Software Engineer fluent in **Agile** development practices. I have years of experience with different programming languages - mainly `Typescript` (`Node` + `React`), `Java` and `Go`. I love to find ways of bringing people and technology together to create innovative products that can solve real world problems. I believe that authentic communication, intercultural collaboration, short feedback cycles and continuous experimenting and learning are the keys to the success of a team, a project and an entire company.

## üßëüèΩ‚Äçüíª  Hello, world!

My name is Fernando Machado. 

I am a Full Stack Software Engineer, fluent with Agile development practices and with more than 15 years of professional experience.

I developed software in a variety of languages: from PHP to Java to Go to a mostly Typescript oriented tech stack with React and Node today.

I designed and colaborated on solutions for problems in different domains, such as: custom content management, meteorology, tool tracking, healthcare and medical appointments, warehouse allocation, education and e-learning, authorization and authentication, web browser automation and payments (with a personal passion for gamification).

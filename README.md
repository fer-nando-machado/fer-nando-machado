# 🌍 Hello, World!

🧑🏽‍💻 My name is Fernando Machado and I have been working as a Full-Stack Software Developer since 2007.

🤲🏽 I am fluent in Agile development practices, have experience with multiple programming languages and love to find ways of bringing people and technology together to create innovative products that can solve real world problems.

🙌🏽 I believe that authentic communication, intercultural collaboration, short feedback cycles and continuous experimenting and learning are the keys to the success of a team, a project and an entire company.

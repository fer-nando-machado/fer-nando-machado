## 🧑🏽‍💻  Hello, world!

My name is Fernando Machado. I am a Full Stack Software Engineer fluent with Agile development practices. I've been coding since 2005 with a variety of languages - my current tech stack leans towards Typescript, Node and React.

I am passionate about bringing people and technology together to create solutions to real life problems - from inception to deployment. I believe that authentic communication, interdisciplinary collaboration and freedom to continuously experiment and learn are the keys to the success of any team.

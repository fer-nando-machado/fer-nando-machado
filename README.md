🧑🏽‍💻 My name is **Fernando Machado**. I have been working as a **Full-Stack Software Developer** since 2007.

🤲🏽 I am fluent in **Agile** development practices, I have experience with multiple programming languages and I love to find ways of bringing people and technology together to create innovative products that can solve real world problems.
